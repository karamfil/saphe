# For a complete introduction, visit the official docs at: https://espanso.org/docs/
# You can about organizing https://espanso.org/docs/matches/organizing-matches/

# You can use this file to define the base matches (aka snippets)
# that will be available in every application when using espanso.

# imports:
#   - "./_bear.yml"

matches:
  - trigger: :espanso replace
    vars:
      - name: "clipboard"
        type: "clipboard"
    replace: |
      - trigger: $|$
        replace: |
          {{clipboard}}

  # # Simple text replacement
  # - trigger: ":espanso"
  #   replace: "Hi there!"

  # # NOTE: espanso uses YAML to define matches, so pay attention to the indentation!

  # # But matches can also be dynamic:

  # # Print the current date
  # - trigger: ":date"
  #   replace: "{{mydate}}"
  #   vars:
  #     - name: mydate
  #       type: date
  #       params:
  #         format: "%m/%d/%Y"

  # # Print the output of a shell command
  # - trigger: ":shell"
  #   replace: "{{output}}"
  #   vars:
  #     - name: output
  #       type: shell
  #       params:
  #         cmd: "echo 'Hello from your shell'"
